The current application is displaying a list of nodes. Each node represents a server. Each server implements the same API but returns different data. The important endpoints you will need to know for each server are:
/api/v1/status
/api/v1/blocks

Each node has many blocks and the blocks for each node are returned from the blocks endpoint.
